Gimp Scripts


To use scripts from this directory, create a soft link to the 'plug-ins' directory in ${HOME}/.gimp-2.8.

%> cd ${HOME}/.gimp-2.8
%> ln -s ${HOME}/Projects/gimp-fu/plug-ins .


If Gimp is already running, close it and re-run it. A menu 'DVIA' will appear. Each entry corresponds to a script in plug-ins directory (as of now three menu entries)
